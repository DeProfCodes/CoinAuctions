Project Initiation


This project was for a client who wanted to start a referal type of network business. The way the business was supposed to operate was buy registered users buy 
virtual "Coins" and hold them as assets. The coins would start earning interests that they would be able to withdraw. There were some automatica daily coins circulation.
Each person's coins would be up for auction at a certain time where they were broacasted to all other users on the app. Other users would then request to buy coins from
the owner of coins. The selling user would get bid requests and would communicate with the bidding users. The bidding user would manually pay the selling users real money
straight to their bank account and then the selling user would approve the purchase on the app, Then the coins would then be credited to the bidding user.
